# CarWiki

## Project Summary 

**Problem Statement:**  
Technical information about car models is often scattered across various sources, making it difficult for users to find all relevant specifications in one place.  

**Target Users:**  
Automotive enthusiasts and individuals researching vehicles prior to purchase.  

**Proposed Solution:**  
CarWiki is an application designed to provide users with easy access to comprehensive technical specifications and details about different car models, all centralized within a single platform.  

**How the Idea Originated:**  
The idea emerged when I attempted to find technical information about a friendâ€™s car but was unable to locate all the details in one reliable source.
